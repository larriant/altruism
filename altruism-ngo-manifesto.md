# Altruism NGO Manifesto

**Two Core Goals:**

* Helping people to have the motivation to help others.
* Once people have the motivation helping them have impact.

**Goals in another form.**

* To spread the idea that the best thing people can do with their lives is commit to helping others.
* To help people find out how they can uniquely contribute to others. And support them in this.

**So in a nutshell we want to teach:**

1. the why\(s\) of altruism
2. the how\(s\).

* This mirrors the two main areas we want to teach people about: the internal aspects of altruism, and the external ones.

## Principles

* Altruism can be actively cultivated and developed.  
* People need rationality to guide their altruistic efforts.
* Everyone has the capacity for altruism, most people act altruistically every day, but they \(and others\) would benefit from them widening the circle of their altruism.
* True altruism is possible - many people doubt this fact. While acts of altruism may incur a financial, material or temporal cost to the giving party, the emotional rewards positively outweigh this. This personal reward does not mean that the action was not altruistic: it remains so if it was carried out only with thought for the other’s wellbeing, and not for oneself.
* Altruism is one of the most reliable sources of personal fulfillment and happiness. It is this factor that is lacking from so many people’s lives in the modern world.
* People need a\) more spaces, opportunities and contexts to exercise altruism and b\) to be directed towards existing ones. Many people are desperate to help the world but do not know how to do so.
* Altruism blossoms in communities united by a shared vision.
* Human altruism can be extended limitlessly and unconditionally, towards all and every being.
* Modern digital technology provides unprecedented opportunities for scalable-without-limit altruistic efforts.
* Total inclusivity: everyone deserves the opportunity to develop their capacity for altruism.
* People need to work on themselves - to realise the futility of selfish actions and the wholesomeness of selfless ones - if they are to be truly effective altruists.
* One of the most altruistic things you can do is make altruists!
* Modern philanthropy and charity focuses almost primarily on distributing financial capital; helping people to be internally happy, to be more altruistic, creative, to realise and exercise their inner and outer freedoms are all neglected causes which would benefit people far more than material wealth.
* The root cause of suffering in the world is psychological: in people’s internal reactions to their experience, not in their experiences themselves \(Buddhism teaches that all suffering is borne of wrong view, i.e. ego-delusion\). Therefore, relieving people’s internal suffering should be a priority of any altruistic project. Further, insight meditation has the potential to completely relieve this internal suffering, making this “awakening” a core goal of any altruism project.
