# Why spread Altruism?

The world faces a **BOOM equation**. Or **The Multidimensional Crisis Revolution**.

We face no less than **nine** simultaneous major global ecological crises.

Our power in terms of technology is increasing exponentially.

What determines our ability to use that power for the good of humanity and the planet: **our values, motivations and principles.**

**Thought:** the world’s biggest problem is that most people are dismissing and ignoring the world’s biggest problems! This tendency usually occurs from a place of self-preoccupation - ultimately a lack of consideration for other people, animals and the environment. Most people are concerned with their problems only, and so we have a global culture of competition. The mindset of altruism is important because it can change the way that people act towards our shared problems, as well as those smaller of other individuals. If everybody began to actively realise their capacity for unconditional friendliness and benevolence, altruistic actions and thus cooperation towards solving the world’s problems would ensue naturally and rapidly. In this way we can catalyse a shift to a global culture of cooperation and compassion.
